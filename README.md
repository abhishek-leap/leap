Remember Points:
    1. We Don't need to use onScroll attribute in Flatlist/VirtualList/SwiperList and if we are using then make sure to append performance settings (removeClippedSubviews,Â initialNumToRender, maxToRenderPerBatch, windowSize, updateCellsBatchingPeriod).

        # Why we need to do above point
         - Because we were using onScroll attribute inside swiperflat list and found crash in realase mode (When we were swipping a video list fast from top to bottom and bottom to top) with iPhone 13 / 13 Pro.
         - This issue was created in Version 1.0 build number 103 and was solved in 104.
